# RSA-Encryption-Library-in-C

This was My 3rd Semester Project. I hope this project guides the user and helps him/her advance even further with modifications in this brilliant (up till now) program. This is the sort of technology that is being used almost everywhere nowadays from whatsapp to army intelligence. With a few modifications this code can be used to rule the world.
Library is in .dll file and and I have also attached a sample code with it.

Here is little Guide Line
namespace: SSoS_HS
classes : Encryptor , DataEncrypt

If you have any Query or suggestions you can contact me at (hashirshoaeb@gmail.com).
Peace. :)

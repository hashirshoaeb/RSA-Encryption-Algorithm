# RSA-Encryption-Library-in-C#
This was My 3rd Semester Project. I hope this project guides the user and helps him/her advance even further with modifications in this brilliant (up till now) program. This is the sort of technology that is being used almost everywhere nowadays from whatsapp to army intelligence. With a few modifications this code can be used to rule the world.
Library is in .dll file and there is a sample code with it.
